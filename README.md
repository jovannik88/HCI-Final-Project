   I introduced better navigation in the form of breadcrumbs and a progress bar. I made data presentation better with boxes and borders. Overall, i made the design cleaner so that users will be able to more easily see what is going on and interact with the quiz.
   The original design is bland, lacks clear structuring and data presentation layout. It lacks clear navigation. Meanwhile, the new design contains all of those through boxes, borders, breadcrumbs, progress bars, etc.


Part B. Implementation of 6 Design Patterns from GL

1. Navigation
   Before:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Navigation_Before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1aa61a5-6ae3-4849-913c-ec93d09f43dd" />

   After:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Navigation_After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff89040c-b2b7-4854-ab64-570ebf2b98bd" />

   I introduced a progress bar, a number count, and breadcrumbs. This applies the design pattern of navigation, where hopefully, the user will be able to know where they are in the website and in the page itself. This solves the problem of users being lost and forgetting or not knowing where they are, and from these additions, hopefully users will be able to interact navigate through the app better. Very important for any app, including mine.
   
2. Input and Forms
   Before:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Input_Before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72825aee-fd45-4e61-bcbd-583896cf5793" />

   After:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Input_After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffe95003-1773-40bb-946e-23c10e71ae20" />

   I made it easier to know where the buttons are and when the user have submitted an answer. This applies the design pattern of input and forms, specifically, making the user know when they are hovering over and choosing an answer. This solves the issue of users not knowing their answers or where to answer, and hopefully makes them able to interact with the questions and answers better. This is important for a quiz app where input is important.

3. Feedback and Status
   Before:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Feedback_Before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83102c8e-4575-4748-a7fb-fdccc0e2b43a" />

   After:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Feedback_After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d24494a5-ce21-4985-93a4-9c5c9debef30" />

   I introduced a popup for to notify the user that their answers have been saved. This applies the design pattern of feedback and status, where a toast/snackbar appears to notify the user of an action, and giving them a feedback. This solves the issue of user not knowing whether their answers have been accepted or not, reducing anxiety, and making the user interaction overall better. Good for a quiz or learning app where worrying about your answer's acceptance by the app itself is not a good thing to have users be concerned above.

4. Layout and Structure
   Before:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Layout_Before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b2e7fbb-1188-4a55-8a60-cd011b3f0c85" />

   After:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Layout_After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cc0bf6f-6620-42eb-8cb5-62b3047b9882" />

   I introduced breakpoints within the page so that mobile users can also use the app. This is important for my app which is a fast and easy english learning app, meaning that most users will be accessing it from phones or mobile devices. This solves the issue of it being pc restricted, and increases the accessibility by a lot. This is of course, layout and structure in the form of breakpoints.

5. Data Presentation
   Before:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Datapresentation_Before" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc2577f-f114-4c5e-9b99-556afaef98a1" />

   After:
   <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="B_Datapresentation_After" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b885ecfe-aa75-451e-8660-f52274b1016d" />

   I put a box and border around the question and answers. This is important because user needs to be able to quickly read the question and know what answers are available. If the user doesn't quickly know what they are going to answer, this will be a big problem. Adding a box increases the data presentation quality of the app and makes user experience faster and requires less effort.

Part C. Evaluation
